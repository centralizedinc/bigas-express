        <h3 class=h1>6. Saan po nanggagaling ang bigas na dinedeliver?</h3>

            All our bigas po is 100% local! Currently the rice we sell are all planted, grown and harvested in the
            Philippine soil. We have partnered with farmers and millers in Ifugao Province, Tarlac, Bulacan, Pampanga,
            Nueva Ecija, and even Iloilo and Visayas. Since we are constantly looking for better and varied sources,
            these may constantly change, but we guarantee that our products are 100% local.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class=h1>7. How is your rice different from supermarket or palengke?</h3>
        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot speak for the rice in the supermarket or palengke, however we can guarantee the following:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bigas Express rice is pure in variety, we do not adulterate, or mix other cheaper varieties of rice to
            the good ones just to make the price cheape
          </li>
          <li>
            he sack we deliver has consistent grain quality from top to bottom. In some of our customer experience,
            when they buy from the supermarket or unknown origin, the top part may be good, but the bottom part of the
            sack has poor quality, again adulterated. We are committed in giving you only the best quality of the variety
          </li>
          <li>
            Bigas Express rice is always freshly milled. We do not stock rice. All your orders are milled-to-order, so we
            can guarantee its freshness. On the supermarket or palengke, you have no idea when the rice was milled or if it
            has been stocked for a long time, or travelled a long way from its country of origin to here in RP.
            that you ordered, top to bottom.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bigas Express ordering is very easy. You can order thru the website, the app and thru FB Chat. You have an excellent 24/7
            Chat Support Team, who are ready to answer all your questions, get your order and re-order, and assist you to make your
            online bigas experience fun and easy.
          </li>
          <li>
            BigasPh offers 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the rice, we will exchange the rice or
            refund you the full amount.
          </li>
          <li>local farmers by making their produce easily available in the market for everybody to enjoy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class=h1>8. Organic po ba ang bigas nyo</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We have some rice that are organic and some that are non organic. We will indicate in the rice description whether
            they are organic or not. However, we are partnering with farmers who use organic fertilizers and implement responsible farming and pest management methods.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class=h1>9. Mabango po ba, malinis at malambot ang bigas nyo?</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Mabango po at amoy bagong bayo ang lahat ng bigas ng Bigas Express, dahil freshly milled po ito.</li>
        <li>
          Malinis, puro at walang halong ibang di magandang bigas.
          Karamihan po ng ating bigas ay malambot. May mga klase naman po ng bigas na sadyang matigas o
          buhaghag. Nasa description po ng bigas kung gusto nyo ay malambot o buhaghag or nasa dami rin ng tubig sa pagsasaing.
        </li>
        <li>Ang white rice ay isinasaing ng 1:1, at ang mga colored rice naman ay 1:2 or 1:3, depende sa lambot na gusto nyo.</li>
        <li>
          Ang colored rice po ay hindi kasing lambot ng white dahil sa pagiging whole grains ng colored rice, kaya mas matagal
          din ang saing.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class=h1>10. How do you help Filipino Farmers</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>
          We have partnered with some filipino farmers to sell their rice online, and compete in the local market. Our market is
          flooded with cheaper imported rice, and it is becoming harder for our farmers to sustain their livelihood usually
          short-selling their produce to the buyers just to break-even or make little profit from their harvest.
        </li>
        <li>
          We only sell local products. We want to let the Filipinos know that our rice is world-class, and if you were to try them
          that you would love them, and paying for it will all be worth it, than buying cheaper, low quality rice that are adulterated.
        </li>
        <li>We are donating part of the sales amount to the rice cooperatives.</li>
